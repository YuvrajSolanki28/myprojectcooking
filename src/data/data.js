      instructions: 'What makes this the best homemade samosa recipe? My foolproof instructions will guarantee that your potatoes and peas samosa are hearty with a perfectly flaky, crispy crust I use a bit less water than some other recipes to make my dough, which creates an ever flakier and crave-able samosa crust Plus, the filling in these Punjabi Samosa is just fantastic. It’s super easy to prepare in a stovetop pressure cooker or using an Instant Pot and in a pan on the stove Green peas and potatoes are blended with classic Indian spices for a warm, satisfying stuffing that will keep you wanting more With a perfect crust and comforting filling, this recipe is a real winner! Give it a try and you’ll be amazed at how simple and fun it is to make samosa recipe from scratch at home Our personal favorite is and will always be a Punjabi Samosa which is what this recipe is all about. The classic potato and green peas stuffing in this recipe is adapted from my cooking school notes I have also made a video which shows the shaping, stuffing and deep frying the Aloo Samosa.

      instructions: 'Chana masala or chickpea curry, often called Amritsari Chole, originates from Punjab but is popular all over India. There are many versions of this dish and every house has its own take on it. This super authentic recipe from my mother-in-law’s kitchen is my favorite, with the chickpeas smothered in a delicious thick, piquant and spiced gravy. First, they are cooked and infused with black tea and black cardamom, then simmered with a masala made with supremely aromatic roasted spices. This dish gets its tang from dried pomegranate seeds and raw mango powder. Though it’s a little bit of work, it is the real McCoy and once you’ve had this version, nothing else will live up to it!',

      instructions: 'Aloo tikki -- or potato patties -- were a staple at my house growing up and my mother’s favorite snack. Stuffed with peas on festive occasions, these patties are best eaten hot, straight from the skillet to the plate. We loved eating these crispy and deliciously savory treats with a piquant cilantro chutney. On the streets in Delhi they are deep fried in oil and served on a plate made of dried leaves. Dredged in breadcrumbs, the patties in this recipe are as crispy as the ones from the streets, and way healthier. Since I can never get enough of the pea filling in the patties, I decided to add peas to the cilantro chutney, which is completely inauthentic but is even better than the real thing',
